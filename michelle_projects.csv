Coding,Movie Service,"In a team of two developers, we developed a full-stack web application and Android app for browsing and purchasing movies,utilizing Tomcat, JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS, and SQL. The application integrated over 1,000 movie entries from the Stanford Movies Database by parsing XML and DTD files, using SQL and JQuery to sort and display data effectively across web pages. In addition, we also developed a user login system with Google API for user authentication, ensuring validation to distinguish between legitmate users and bots. The application was deployed the application on the Amazon Web Services EC2 for reliable hosting and scalability on a HTTPS server.","Java, Javascript, RestAPI, TomCat, Maven, HTML, CSS, GitHub, Android Studio, SQL, XML, DTD, AWS E2",https://github.com/buimichelle/MovieService,
Coding,Web Crawler,"In a team of four developers, we created a www.ics.uci.edu web crawlers that returned a list of downloadable URLs. It must returned a rough list within a certain time frame. We used Python and Beautiful Soup. ","Python, BeautifulSoup",0,Please email me to see this code.
Coding,Search Engine,"In a team of three developers, we build a high-performance search engine using Python, featuring a front-end UI for seamless user interaction. We analyzed over 10,00 potential URL links to delievers the most relevant query results, leveraging TF-IDF Methodoglogies for efficient information retrieval. We achieved a sub-300ms query response times by optimizing operations with the Pandas library under stringent performance constraints.","Python, BeautifulSoup",0,Please email me to see this code.

Coding,Fashion MNIST Classifier,"I analyzed the Fashion MNIST dataset (60,000 training examples, 10,000 test examples) using Scikit-learn for classical models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests) and PyTorch for Feedforward Neural Networks to find which classical models work best for the dataset. I achieved 90% validation accuracy with a Neural Network by fine-tuning hyperparameters (hidden_layer_sizes=1024, 128, 16; max_epochs=100). In addition, I documented model performance, highlighting overfitting, underfitting, and misclassification issues, with visualizations using Matplotlib.","Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Classical Models (Logistic Regression, KNN, zrandom Forest), Pytorch, Documentation, Reporting, Matpotlib, Visuzalitoin",0,Please email me to see this code.
Data Analytics,NYC Eviction,"In a group of 4 Analysts, we analyzed and reviewed over 68,000 eviction records across NYCâ€™s five boroughs using Tableau and Excel, providing data-driven insights and preparing detailed reports on eviction trends for department use.
